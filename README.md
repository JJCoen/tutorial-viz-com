The following text created by original authors.

Effective visual communication is essential in every step of a quantitative workflow, from scoping to execution and communicating results and conclusions. With this competency, we can better understand data and influence decisions towards appropriate actions. Without it, we can fool ourselves and others and pave the way to wrong conclusions and actions. The goal of this tutorial is to convey this competency. We posit three laws of effective visual communication for the quantitative scientist: have a clear purpose, show the data clearly, and make the message obvious.

We have prepared a tutorial on “Effective visual communication for the quantitative scientist” which available and [online at CPT:PSP](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psp4.12455).
